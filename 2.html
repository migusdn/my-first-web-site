    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is <strong>a style sheet language</strong> used for describing the presentation of a
    document written in
    a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone
    technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">CSS</a> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
    content, including layout, colors, and
    fonts.[3] This
    separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
    presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
    separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
    be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
</p>
<p>
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
    different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and
    on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile
    device.[4]
