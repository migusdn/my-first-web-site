<h2>JavaScript 이란?</h2>
<img alt="javascript image" height="100%" src="javascript.png">
<p>is a <strong>programming language that is one of the core technologies</strong> of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
    and CSS.[11] As
    of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party
    libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled
    language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has
    dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting
    event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for
    working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
<p>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</p>
